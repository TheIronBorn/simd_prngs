simd-prngs
====

A crate researching various SIMD PRNGs.
You need nightly Rust and SIMD capable hardware to use this crate.
To use it, run:
```console
$ RUSTFLAGS='-C target-cpu=native' cargo bench
```

Also provided is a utility for printing a PRNG's output to stdout for use with testing utilities like [PractRand](http://pracrand.sourceforge.net/): `src/bin/cat_rng.rs`.

Note: not all implementations of PRNGs are verified to be correct.

## Currently implemented PRNGs
- `Ars5`, `Ars7`: An AES implementation optimized for non-cryptographic designed by D. E. Shaw Research
- `rand_sse`: An LCG designed for SSE2 hardware by Intel
- `Jsf32`, `Jsf64`: A small chaotic PRNG designed by Bob Jenkins.
- `Sfc32`, `Sfc64`: A small chaotic PRNG combined with a counter, designed by Chris Doty-Humphrey.
- `Xorshift32`, `Xorshift128`: A Xorshift PRNG (32/32-bit and 128/32-bit variants).
- `Xorshift128Plus`: The Xorshift128+ PRNG.
- `Xoroshiro128StarStar`: The Xoroshiro128** PRNG.
- `Xoshiro256StarStar`: The Xoshiro256** PRNG
- `Pcg32`: A PCG PRNG (XSH 64/32 RR (LCG) variant).
- `Xsm32`, `Xsm64`: A small random-access PRNG designed by Chris Doty-Humphrey
- `ChaCha4`: A stream cipher designed by Daniel J. Bernstein. We reduce the rounds to 4 for a faster non-cryptographic version.

Most of the PRNGs are parallelized scalar PRNGs. For most of those, variants with all vector lanes available with [`stdsimd`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/stdsimd) are provided.

## Currently implemented stream features
- `Xoroshiro`: equally-spaced blocks via Xoroshiro's jumping features, `blocks_from_rng`
- `Xoshiro`: equally-spaced blocks via Xoshiro's jumping features, `blocks_from_rng`
- `Pcg`: random LCG increments
- `Xsm`: equally-spaced blocks via XSM's `seek_forward`, `blocks_from_rng`

Otherwise, parallel PRNGs are given a random seed for each stream with `SeedableRng`. The probabilities of stream correlation for such a method are listed in the source code for each PRNG.

## Possible future work
- Other counter-based PRNGs inspired by [Random123](http://www.deshawresearch.com/resources_random123.html). They offer Threefry and Philox but both are too slow to be worthwhile. A faster vectorizable pseudo-random permutation/bijection might be viable (see below). AVX-512 offers instructions which would allow 8 64-bit widening multiplications at once which is roughly equivalent to 8 rounds of Philox2Ã—64.
- Block ciphers/hashes. Any fast, statistically strong, vectorizable block cipher or hash would be viable. Weakening cryptographic algorithms could be fruitful. Most wouldn't need multiple streams as they tend to generate blocks of data. If multiple streams were implemented though, avoiding correlation would be easy in counter mode.
- [Mrg32k3a](https://www.informs-sim.org/wsc00papers/090.PDF) is a popular choice for its large period and convenient streaming features, although it is a little slow. If it could be sped up with newer instructions it might be viable.
